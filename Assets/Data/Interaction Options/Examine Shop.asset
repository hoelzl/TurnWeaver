  objectDescription: '<b>A Shop</b>


    This is a shop. You can do whatever you
    normally do in a shop. That is, mostly spend money.


    You can also sell stuff
    to get some money back, but normally shops will give you much less money for
    stuff you sell to them than they ask for stuff you buy.'
